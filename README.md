A simple arithmetic-practice standalone page

Simply open the HTML file in the browser of your choice.

Then type the answer to the math problem appearing on the screen.

There are two special keys:

 - Enter presents a new problem (once the current problem is solved)
 - Backspace clears out whatever was typed (if you don't type it too soon)
