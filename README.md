# homeschool
A simple arithmetic-practice standalone page. [Try it out hosted on Github Pages](https://yoderj.github.io/homeschool/) or on your own machine. Everything runs in the browser, so nothing leaves your computer -- thus there are no privacy concerns.

Simply open the HTML file in the browser of your choice.

Then type the answer to the math problem appearing on the screen.

There are two special keys:

 - Enter presents a new problem (once the current problem is solved)
 - Backspace clears out whatever was typed (if you don't type it too soon)

Please submit merge requests with new features that your family likes!
